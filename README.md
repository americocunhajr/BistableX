## Bistable eXploration in Energy Harvesting
**BistableX: Bistable eXploration in Energy Harvesting** is a comprehensive dataset comprising experimental measurements from a bistable energy harvester tested under both symmetric and asymmetric configurations. The repository includes frequency response data, power output records, state-space trajectories, and Poincaré maps that capture the nonlinear dynamic behavior of the system under varied excitation conditions. This dataset is intended to support research in nonlinear dynamics, energy harvesting, and structural health monitoring, providing a robust benchmark for validating new computational models.

### Overview
**BistableX** was developed to conduct nonlinear analysis on bistable piezoelectric-magneto-elastic energy harvesters. The code functionalities are reported in the following publication:
- **J. P. Norenberg and P. S. Varoto and S. da Silva and A. Cunha Jr**, *Asymmetry-enhanced performance in bistable energy harvesters: An experimental study*, under review, 2025. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/xxx" target="_blank">DOI</a>

### Features
- **Extensive Experimental Data:** Data from a custom-designed bistable energy harvester, including measurements under symmetric and controlled asymmetric conditions (achieved via magnet rotation and base tilting).

- **Dynamic Characterization:** Frequency response functions (FRFs), power output measurements, and state-space reconstructions that reveal both monostable and chaotic behaviors.

- **Detailed Metadata:** Comprehensive documentation of test configurations, excitation parameters, and measurement protocols to ensure reproducibility.

- **Validation and Benchmarking:** Data suitable for validating numerical models and comparing the performance of energy harvesting strategies.
