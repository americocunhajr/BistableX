
This repository provides experimental data in two formats: .mat and .csv. 
The data was acquired using a data acquisition system and post-processed for analysis. This document describes the structure, content, and meaning of each dataset and variable.

Each signal channel corresponds to a specific physical quantity:
Channel 1 (subscript 1): Acceleration of the base [g]
Channel 2 (subscript 2): Voltage from the piezoelectric harvester [V]
Channel 3 (subscript 3): Velocity measured by laser vibrometer [m/s]


Data Formats
1. .mat Files
These files contain all raw and processed data exported directly from the data acquisition (DAQ) software.

Each variable is a matrix organized as (frequency/time, signal):
C – Coherence functions:
C1_2: Coherence between channels 2 and 1
C1_3: Coherence between channels 3 and 1

H – Frequency Response Functions (FRFs):
H1_2: FRF from voltage to base acceleration
H1_3: FRF from velocity to base acceleration

S – Frequency spectra:
S1, S2, S3: Spectra for channels 1, 2, and 3, respectively

X – Time-domain signals:
X1, X2, X3: Time series of channels 1, 2, and 3, respectively


2. .csv Files
These are processed files and are organized by folder according to the type of analysis performed.

swept_freq/ Folder
Contains FRF results from frequency sweep experiments.

single_freq/ Folder
Contains time-domain responses for single-frequency excitation tests.

poincare_analysis/ Folder
These files provide data for phase-space (Poincaré section) analysis. All datasets are organized as columns corresponding to state variables.
